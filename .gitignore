# If you want to keep the API key and secret key out of the pushed app.py:
# Temporarily comment out these lines in app.py for now:
# genai.configure(api_key="AIzaSyAPY6RgantTwOcSYO79gCH5G_-EB4q-fG4")
# app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'
# And instead, read them from environment variables or a .env file,
# which are ignored by .gitignore. For this quick push, just remember the warning.
